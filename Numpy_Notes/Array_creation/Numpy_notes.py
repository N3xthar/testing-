import numpy as np 

# numpy stands for numerical pythons using the array !!

# BENEFITS :==
# 1 ) numpy is much faster oridinary pyhtons 
# 2 ) less memory usage 
# 3 ) easy maths operations !! 
# 4 ) its about turbo charger calculator calculate the billions of data !! 
# 5 medical research 
# 6 also use in the image clarafaction 


temperature = np.array([30,34,22,4,5,0,0,55,4,6,] )
average = np.mean(temperature)
print(average)

#  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMPY ARRAY AND THE PYTHON  LIST !! 

# python list !

python_list = [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
print(python_list)

# o/p  := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# numpy array  !! 
numpy_list = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
print(numpy_list)

# o/p  : == [1 2 3 4 5 6 7] this store in the numpy as it is very effective it store without the comas
